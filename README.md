## Overview

Here is the overview of the entire project;

### Challenges:

- **Storing Book Objects**: Implementing a function to store user input as new book objects in an array.

- **Displaying Books**: Dynamically creating HTML elements to display each book in the array.

- **Adding a New Book Form**: Creating a form for users to input book details and preventing default form submission behavior.

- **Associating DOM Elements with Book Objects**: Linking DOM elements to specific book objects to enable interaction.

- **Removing Books**: Handling user interactions to remove books from the library array and update the UI accordingly.

- **Changing Read Status**: Implementing a button to toggle the read status of a book and updating the UI.

- **User Input Validation**: Validating user input to maintain data integrity and prevent errors.

- **UI/UX Design**: Designing an intuitive interface for adding, displaying, and interacting with books.

### Features:

- **Add Books**: Users can input book details and add them to the library.

- **Display Books**: Books in the library are displayed on the page, either in a table or as individual cards.

- **New Book Form**: A form allows users to input book details such as author, title, number of pages, and read status.

- **Remove Books**: Users can remove books from the library.

- **Change Read Status**: Users can toggle the read status of a book.

- **User Input Validation**: Input fields are validated to ensure data integrity.

- **Intuitive UI**: The interface is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive for adding, displaying, and interacting with books.

### Learning Points:

- **Object-Oriented JavaScript**: Practicing object-oriented programming principles by creating book objects and manipulating them.

- **DOM Manipulation**: Learning how to dynamically update the DOM to display and interact with data.

- **Form Handling**: Understanding how to create and handle form submissions in HTML and JavaScript.

- **Event Handling**: Practicing event handling to respond to user interactions such as clicks and submissions.

- **Array Manipulation**: Learning how to add, remove, and modify elements in JavaScript arrays.

- **Input Validation**: Implementing input validation techniques to ensure data integrity and prevent errors.

- **User Interface Design**: Gaining experience in designing user-friendly interfaces for web applications.

- **Problem-Solving**: Developing problem-solving skills by tackling challenges such as data management and user interaction.

- **Version Control**: Practicing version control with Git to track changes and collaborate on the project.

### Continued Development:

- **Refactoring**: Learning how to refactor code to improve readability, performance, and maintainability.

- **Testing**: Exploring testing methodologies such as unit testing and integration testing to ensure the reliability of the application.

- **Error Handling**: Implementing error handling techniques to gracefully handle unexpected situations and provide meaningful feedback to users.

- **Optimization**: Optimizing the application for performance by identifying and addressing bottlenecks in code or resource usage.

- **Accessibility**: Enhancing accessibility features to ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities.

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Testing and ensuring the application works correctly across different web browsers and platforms.

- **Security**: Implementing security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and injection attacks.

- **Documentation**: Improving documentation to make the codebase more understandable for other developers and future maintenance.

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Setting up automated pipelines for building, testing, and deploying the application to streamline the development process.

- **Feedback and Iteration**: Incorporating user feedback and iterating on the application to continuously improve its functionality and user experience.
